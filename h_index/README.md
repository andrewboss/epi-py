# Problem

The h-index is a metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of a researcher.
Specifically, a researcher's h-index is the largest number h such that the researcher has published
papers that each been cited at least h times. For example, if Carl has published papers
A, B,C, D, E, F, G, H, I, which have been cited 1, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6 times, respectively, then his h-index
is 4 (corresponding to the papers B, D, H, I).

Design an algorithm that determines a researcher's h-index.

You should be able to code this algorithm and test it in a matter of few minutes.
